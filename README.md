# National Weather Service api
a simple passthrough api that connects to the national weather service

#Write a RESTful API that serves the forecasted weather. Your server should expose an endpoint that:

- [ ] Accepts latitude and longitude coordinates
- [ ] Returns the short forecast for that area for Today (“Partly Cloudy” etc)
- [ ] Returns a characterization of whether the temperature is “hot”, “cold”, or “moderate” (use your discretion on mapping temperatures to each type)
- [ ] Use the National Weather Service API Web Service as a data source.
